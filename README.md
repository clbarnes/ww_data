# WormWiring data tables

Plaintext datasets from [WormWiring](http://wormwiring.org/series/),
under git control for version-pinning purposes.

[last_changed.txt](./last_changed.txt) contains

- a 32-character hexadecimal md5 hashsum of the contents of [./data](./data),
- a line break
- a UTC timestamp of when the [./populate.py](./populate.py) script last changed the data, in [ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format

## Populate

In a python 3.7+ environment fulfilling the requirements (see [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt)), run

```bash
./populate.py
```

This will scrape the WormWiring website for CSV and TSV tables.
They will be standardised (given the same headers, strings stripped, lists sorted) and saved.

If the dataset has changed, [last_changed.txt](./last_changed.txt) will be updated.
